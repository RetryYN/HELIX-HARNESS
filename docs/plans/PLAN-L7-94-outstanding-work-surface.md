# PLAN-L7-94 (impl): outstanding-work surface (IMP-139)

## 0. Objective

「未了の正の集計シグナル」(非終端 PLAN の層別数 + open defer 数 + 意味別待ち理由) を `ut-tdd status --json` と
handover CURRENT.json に **additive** に surface し、「doctor green = 完了」誤読 (PLAN 完了 ≠ 層完了) を
機械照合可能にする。informational surface であり gate ではない。

## 1. Problem (IMP-139)

`ut-tdd status` (mode + next のみ) も handover digest (commits/files/failures のみ) も CURRENT.json も
「層内の非終端 (draft 等) PLAN 数 / open な explicit-defer 数」を出さない。merged-plan-status
([[PLAN-L7-87]]) / plan-completion-drift ([[PLAN-L7-93]]) は drift を fail-close 検出するが、それは
「異常」検出であって「未了の総量」を可視化しない。結果、完了主張が機械照合不能だった
([[feedback_coverage_not_substance]] / [[feedback_verify_carry_status_against_code]])。

## 2. Fix

`src/lint/outstanding.ts` (新規) + status / handover 配線:

- `analyzeOutstandingWork(plans, openDefers)`: 非終端 PLAN を layer 別集計 (純関数)。
  terminal (confirmed/completed/accepted) と archived を除外、key 昇順、openDefers は Math.max(0)。
- `blockersByKind` / `items`: 非終端 PLAN を `version_up_parked`、`po_decision_pending`、
  `human_approval_pending`、`irreversible_migration_pending`、`active_draft` に分類する。これは完了判定ではなく、
  「要求・設計・承認・将来版保全のどこで止まっているか」を status/handover から照合するための意味 surface。
- `items[].requiredAction` / `items[].requiredEvidence`: blocker を人間が再解釈しなくても、S4 decision、
  version-up activation、action-binding approval、不可逆 cutover signoff のどの証跡を足せば進められるかを
  PLAN 単位で出す。これは自動承認ではなく、承認なしに進めてはいけない境界を明示するための additive surface。
- `completionReadiness`: `nonTerminalPlansTotal` / `openDefers` / `blockersByKind` を全件完了 claim 用に集約し、
  `ready` / `blocked` と required actions を返す。これは doctor health と分離した判定で、doctor green を
  L14 全件達成の代替にしない。
- `completionDecisionPacketForOutstanding`: `completionReadiness` が blocked のとき、未了 PLAN を
  `po_s4_decision` / `version_up_activation` / `human_action_approval` /
  `irreversible_migration_signoff` / `workflow_continuation` の decision item に変換する。
  各 item は allowed outcomes と next workflow route を持ち、PO が何を記録すれば S4 / version-up / L14
  cutover へ進めるかを機械出力にする。これは判断代行ではなく、判断待ちの証跡化である。
- decision packet は `generatedAt` / `sourceCommand` / `freshness` を持つ。freshness は
  `decision-packet-freshness.v1`、既定 `validForMinutes=1440`、`expiresAt` 超過で `stale=true`。
  `status --json` に埋め込まれた packet は `sourceCommand=ut-tdd status --json`、standalone packet は
  `sourceCommand=ut-tdd completion decision-packet --json` とし、古い転記や生成元不明の判断材料を避ける。
- `src/lint/completion-decision-packet.ts`: generatedFrom / ok-status 整合 / generatedAt /
  sourceCommand / freshness policy-window-expiresAt / stale flag / decisionCount を doctor hard gate として
  検査する。outstanding 集計は informational surface のままだが、完了判断 packet の鮮度・出所・形は
  fail-close で担保する。2026-06-30 continuation 9 で各 decision item の `requiredRecords`
  (recordName / fields / sourcePaths) も検査対象にし、各 PLAN の全 blocker から record schema を合成する。
  これにより PO/S4 と action-binding approval が同じ PLAN に同居しても承認 record が packet から落ちず、
  PO 判断 packet が文章の requiredEvidence だけに戻ることを防ぐ。2026-06-30 continuation 15 で
  `allowedOutcomesByRecord` を追加し、primary blocker 以外の record outcome (例: action-binding approval) が
  allowed outcomes から落ちる状態も fail-close にした。2026-06-30 continuation 16 で
  `nextWorkflowRoutesByRecord` を追加し、primary blocker 以外の record route (例: action-binding approval /
  parked review) が next route から落ちる状態も fail-close にした。2026-06-30 continuation 27 で
  `allowedOutcomesByRecord` は record 名ごとの canonical outcome 集合と一致すること、`nextWorkflowRoutesByRecord`
  は record 名ごとの canonical route guidance を含むことまで検査し、非空だが意味が drift した outcome/route
  を fail-close する。2026-06-30 continuation 28 で requiredRecords / allowedOutcomesByRecord /
  nextWorkflowRoutesByRecord / recordTemplates の recordName 集合が一対一であることを検査し、同名重複や
  required record に無い余剰 metadata を fail-close する。2026-07-01 continuation 29 で decision item 直下の
  `decisionKind` / `allowedOutcomes` / `nextWorkflowRoute` も primary `blockerReason` と照合し、record-level
  metadata は正しいが top-level decision が別 blocker の kind/outcome/route を示す packet を fail-close する。
  2026-06-30 continuation 17 で
  `recordTemplates` を追加し、requiredRecords の各 record を PLAN に記録するための copyable YAML block
  (`recordName:` header、`insertionHint`、全 required field の `- field:` 行) を packet に含める。template 欠落や
  field 欠落は fail-close し、PO/人間判断が prose-only requiredEvidence に戻る状態を防ぐ。2026-06-30
  continuation 26 で template guidance も record ごとの意味契約に含め、field は揃っているが S4 route /
  version-up activation route / L14 cutover execution control / action-binding least-privilege 制約を示さない
  弱い template を `invalid_record_template` として fail-close する。
- 2026-06-30 continuation 20 で `sourcePaths` を repo-aware に検査する。`requiredRecords[].sourcePaths[]`
  は repo-relative 実在ファイルでなければならず、absolute path / drive-letter path / `..` / missing file は
  `invalid_required_record_source_path` として fail-close する。これにより decision packet が存在しない要件・
  workflow 根拠を指していても shape だけで green になる状態を防ぐ。
- `src/lint/action-binding-approval-readiness.ts`: high-impact approval / action-binding / human approval を含む
  非終端 PLAN が `action_binding_approval_record` を本文に持つことを doctor hard gate として検査する。
  record は `allowed_outcome`、`approval_policy_or_named_approver`、`approval_scope`、
  `approved_actor`、`approved_tool`、`approved_target`、`approved_params`、
  `review_approval_evidence`、`expires_at_or_trigger`、`audit_record` を必須にする。これは承認代行ではなく、
  承認前に actor / tool / target / params / expiry / audit route を個別 field として固定して
  prose-only approval や scope への丸め込みを防ぐ gate である。
  2026-07-01 continuation 31 で `buildActionBindingApprovalPackets` と
  `ut-tdd action-binding approval-packet` を追加し、high-impact approval PLAN を
  `action-binding-approval-packet.v1` として独立出力する。packet は `planOnly=true`、
  `mustNotApprove=true`、`approvalCommandAvailable=false`、`approvalAllowed=false` を固定し、
  `approve_action_binding` / `deny_action` / `request_scope_reduction` の route と
  current `action_binding_approval_record` の actor/tool/target/params 欠落理由を出す。これにより
  action-binding 承認が completion packet の補助 record に埋もれず、PO / named approver の意味判断面として
  分離されるが、承認記録・適用・外部 action 実行は行わない。
- `src/lint/source-ledger-freshness.ts`: external-source ledger の `checked YYYY-MM-DD` を共通検査する。
  未来日、または現在日から 90 日超過の ledger は stale とし、S4 decision / version-up activation /
  L14 cutover / completion decision packet の判断材料にしない。これは source row/column/adoption decision が
  揃っていても、外部公式ソースの再確認が古ければ fail-close するための横断 helper である。
  `sourceLedgerHeadingPattern` は `checked` 日付を `2026-06-30` 固定にせず、再確認日を更新しても
  parser が ledger table を読み続けることを保証する。
- `src/lint/shared.ts`: `allowedOutcomeSetViolation` を追加し、decision record の `allowed_outcome` を
  非空 field ではなく、設計 enum と同じ集合として検査する。S4 / version-up activation / L14 cutover /
  action-binding approval のいずれも、未知 outcome 混入または必須 outcome 欠落を fail-close し、機能一覧・
  decision packet・PLAN record が意味的にずれたまま shape だけで green になる状態を防ぐ。
- `src/lint/version-up-readiness.ts`: version-up parked PLAN の activation を plain draft / indefinite future へ戻さない。
  `activation_decision_record` は `target_version_or_release_trigger` と `activation_route` を必須にし、将来版 activation が
  add-feature / Forward のどの route へ戻るかを構造化する。外部 activation は引き続き action-binding approval
  / escalation boundary / dry-run / rollback なしに進めない。
- `src/lint/s4-decision-readiness.ts`: S3 pending PoC の S4 判断材料を `decision_basis` 自由文から
  `verified_evidence`、`stakeholder_review_or_proxy`、`acceptance_gap`、`unresolved_risk`、
  `external_source_basis`、`route_impact`、`promotion_strategy_or_rejection_pivot_rationale` に分解する。Discovery/Scrum mode doc の S4 decision source ledger は
  official URL、adopted version/date、latest official status、adoption decision、S4 decision use、
  required field impact を持ち、Scrum Guide / ISO 29148 / ISTQB / NIST SSDF のいずれかを落とすと fail-close する。
  ledger の `checked` が未来日または 90 日超過 stale の場合も fail-close し、古い外部根拠で S4 に進めない。
  2026-06-30 continuation 22 で terminal S4 PoC (`workflow_phase=S4` + `decision_outcome`) も同じ
  `s4_decision_record` 検査対象にした。これにより confirmed/completed PLAN の frontmatter だけで
  PO/S4 basis、route、risk、Reverse fullback を証跡化した扱いにしない。
- `src/lint/cutover-readiness.ts`: L14 cutover の source ledger を official URL、adopted version/date、
  latest official status、adoption decision、cutover use、required field impact で検査する。NIST SSDF、
  GitHub Environments required reviewers、GitHub Actions concurrency、Google SRE Release Engineering、
  OWASP LLM06、SLSA Provenance のいずれかを落とす、または adoption decision を空にすると fail-close する。
  ledger の `checked` が未来日または 90 日超過 stale の場合も fail-close し、古い cutover 外部根拠で
  irreversible migration signoff に進めない。
  `cutover_decision_record` は `execution_window_or_freeze_policy` を必須にし、不可逆 apply が承認後の
  HEAD/scope drift や並行実行で実行時条件をすり替えられないようにする。
- `loadOutstandingPlanRows(repoRoot)`: docs/plans frontmatter から layer/status (registry を介さず最新値)。
- `computeOutstandingWork(repoRoot)`: open defer = placeholder-deps `specBackfillWaits` を合成
  (上位仕様確定待ちの正当な carry、threshold は descent-obligation 担当)。I/O 失敗は fail-open。
- status `--json` に `outstanding` と `completionDecisionPacket` を additive
  (既存 6 field + nextAction 不変、A-138/PLAN-L7-84 前例)。status text に `outstandingSummaryLine`、
  `completionReadinessLine`、blocked 時の `ut-tdd completion decision-packet --json` 導線を出す。
- `ut-tdd completion decision-packet [--json]` が同じ outstanding 正本から decision packet を出す。
- handover `runHandover` が CURRENT.json pointer に `outstanding` と同じ生成時点の
  `completionDecisionPacket` (`sourceCommand=ut-tdd handover`) を additive 記録し、`ut-tdd handover status --json`
  から再開時にも recordTemplates を含む PO/S4・version-up・cutover・action-binding 判断 packet を読める。
- doctor `handover-decision-packet` hard gate が、blocked outstanding を持つ handover CURRENT.json に
  `completionDecisionPacket` が存在し、`sourceCommand=ut-tdd handover`、freshness/shape lint OK、
  `completionReadiness` と ok/status 一致、`outstanding.items.length` と decision count 一致であることを検査する。
  これにより standalone `completion decision-packet` が green でも、resume surface の旧 pointer が recordTemplates を
  落としている状態を doctor green で隠さない。

| Source | How it constrains this packet |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| NIST SSDF SP 800-218: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final | Decision evidence must be traceable to current verification / provenance, not stale prose. |
| GitHub Environments deployment protection rules: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments | Approval/wait boundaries are first-class protected steps, so generated decision material needs source and expiry. |
| Scrum Guide 2020: https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html | Review/decision output is an adaptation point; S4 packets must be fresh enough to guide the next route. |
| OWASP LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency: https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm062025-excessive-agency/ | High-impact agentic actions need constrained authority, human oversight, and auditable approval scope. |

placement: placeholder-deps / shared を再利用するため解析層 `src/lint/outstanding.ts` に置く
(runtime→lint は coding-rules module-boundary 違反ゆえ、消費側 cli / handover が lint を import する形)。

## 4. Out of scope

- 専用 harness.db 物理表の新設 = 集計はオンデマンド導出で足り、db-projection-coverage gate を増やさない
  (将来 telemetry 集計が要れば別 PLAN)。
- 非終端の fail-close 化 = 本 surface は「正の量」の可視化であり、drift の fail-close は
  merged-plan-status / plan-completion-drift が担当 (相補)。
